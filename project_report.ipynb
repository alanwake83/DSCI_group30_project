    "Thallium scintigraphy tests are a type of cardiography test used primarily within patients with artery diseases, and atypical chest pains, but can be used for a variety of heart diseases, as a form of non-invasive myocardial imaging that can tell if a patient's defect by how much blood can flow through vesicles (Arrighi, 2019). The results of this test are classified into three types: no defect, a fixed defect in which only scar tissue exists, and a reversible defect in which both scar and viable heart tissues exist (Mckillop, 1980). These tests are typically done in a clinical setting while quantifying a number of other variables such as maximum heart rate, blood pressure and age of the person taking the test, and are accompanied by other tests such as tests which quantify exercise-induced ST depression. The goal of this project is to answer how are the results of a Thallium scintigraphy test determining heart defect severity, and therefore how is heart defect severity, affected by age, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate achieved in-test, and ST depression. We think that the four predictor variables will all impact the likelihood of the THAL test having a specific result. For AGE for example, previous research has shown that heart failure is very common in elderly due to the fact that the structure and function of the heart is affected by a variety of factors, including natural aging, chronic disease and medication, so we would predict that the results will show an increase in fixed defects and reversible defects in older people (Benjamin, 2019). ST depression (OLDPEAK) can also play a role in signifying heart disease as it is the difference between ST-segment depression observed during exercise compared to rest, higher depressions increase chances for more severe defects (Lazzarni, 2013). Abnormally high heart rate (THALACH), which is quantified in the THAL tests can also be considered as a sign of heart diseases (Bassan, 2005), this is also seen in systolic blood pressure (TRESTBPS) which when high can actually lead to a higher chance of getting a heart defect (Vasan, 2001). From the above information we can see that each of these variables can be used as predictors and thus can be helpful in  real-life settings. Quantifying which variables are significant predictors can help healthcare workers or patients themselves determine when to look for a heart defect, for example increasing the frequency of tests once a patient reaches the age that our data shows an increase of heart defects at.
